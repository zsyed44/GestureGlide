# GestureGlide (Work in Progress)

GestureGlide is an experimental project aimed at revolutionizing RC car control using sensor-equipped mechanical gloves. This repository is a work in progress—our prototype is in the early alpha stage, and we’re actively developing, testing, and refining the technology. Contributions, feedback, and creative ideas are welcome!

## Project Vision
GestureGlide aims to create an intuitive and futuristic driving experience by translating natural hand gestures into precise movements of an RC car. Our goal is to merge cutting-edge sensor technology with creative control methods to open up new ways of interacting with remote vehicles.

## Current Status
- **Development Stage:** Alpha (Prototype)
- **Implemented:** 
- **Under Development:**
  - Basic gesture detection and initial RC car control 
  - Improved sensor calibration and filtering algorithms
  - Enhanced wireless communication reliability
  - Expanded gesture command library
  - User feedback integration for real-time adjustments

## Planned Features
- **Advanced Gesture Recognition:** Fine-tune detection for smoother, more intuitive control.
- **Real-Time Feedback System:** Add haptic or visual cues for immediate, responsive control.
- **Mobile Configuration Interface:** Develop a companion app for tuning settings and diagnostics.
- **Open Source Hardware Designs:** Release complete schematics for community collaboration.
- **Modular Software Architecture:** Facilitate future expansion and integration of additional features.

## Setup & Requirements
### Hardware
- Mechanical gloves with integrated sensors (e.g., flex sensors, IMUs)
- RC car chassis or custom-built vehicle platform
- Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi)
- Wireless communication module (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or RF)

### Software
- Programming environments for Python and/or C/C++
- Prototype code that is under active revision
